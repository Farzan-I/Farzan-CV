Detail oriented 30 year old professional, current Makers Academy student (April '22 intake) about to complete full time coding bootcamp. Learnt the fundamentals of the computers command line, extensive hours trying to perfect the use of git commands and branching/merging while completing Ruby and JavaScript projects using an extensive list of technological tools.

After graduating from London Metropolitan University with a first class with honours degree in Business Management, I spent a year working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car through their graduate scheme. Here I came to terms with the IBM software Ralph that started my fascination for software development. I also spent 6 months in Dubai working as a wealth advisor before I came back to the UK and had roles as a senior lettings negotiator and then after a supervisor in Pret A Manger. I have spent the last 8 months learning how to code and 4 of which has been with Makers Academy software development bootcamp.

#### Excellent Communicator

During my time at deVere Group, I wrote and distributed client quarterly reports as well as providing them with regular updates on their investments. While at Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I was pinpointed for providing clarity on many issues customers (corporate and public) faced, such as what seemed to be bogus charges on their rental agreement or the mark-up insurance they did not know about before they rented their vehicles. My communication skills have been underlined by my time at Makers as I have provided coherence on the various teams I was in. These, as well as my written communication skills have been rehearsed in my [blogs](https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh).

#### Thrives under pressure
From having to organise an end-of-year prom during my final year of secondary school, where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing GCSE exams, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this. These, coupled with my competitive nature, allow me to work effectively when also under a time constraint.

#### Fast learner
I earned a full-time offer from deVere Group by impressing my line and regional manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of finance and the various financial products that the team used and sold to clients. Despite having a business management background, I was told only 1 out of 200 candidates would pass the rigorous job screening. For our [Acebook project](https://github.com/Farzan-I/acebook), I learnt Node.js and Express without it being taught on the course and used it to build a fully-functioning Airbnb-style website in a week.

#### Shrude negotiater
In my role at AXM London, I worked extensive hours to finalise deals in a few of the most saught after areas of London (Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Paddington, Marylebone). This meant dealing
