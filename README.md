Detail orientated professional, recent [Makers Academy](#makers-academy-mar-2022-to-jul-2022) graduate (April '22 - July '22). Learnt the fundamentals of the command line, perfecting the use of git alongside completing Ruby, JavaScript (MERN/MEHN) projects using an extensive list of technological tools, while implementing agile methodologies.

As a [marketing executive](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020), I sculpted the [company's website](https://www.culturalsignatures.com) with no prior coding experience. This gave me a great insight and thirst for software engineering. Graduating from [London Metropolitan University](#london-metropolitan-university-sep-2010-to-jul-2014) with a first class degree in Business Management, I spent a year working for [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015-management-trainee) on their graduate scheme. Here, I encountered the IBM software Ralph that started my fascination for software development. I have spent the last 18 months learning how to code, 4 of which have been with [Makers Academy boot camp](https://makers.tech/). I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails in my spare time.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

* While at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), many clients felt in the dark in regards to their investments. I provided quarterly reports as well as weekly updates on their investments within two weeks of joining the team. This put a client's mind at ease, built rapport during uncertain times, created more transparency that led to more investment and in turn created a customer for life
* Coding can be a daunting feat, especially if there's no clarity. At [Makers](#makers-academy-mar-2022-to-jul-2022), I learnt how to use [Miro](https://miro.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com/en) boards effectively to build a better understanding of the features, objectives and direction that a project/task should go towards. This involved writing user stories to see the app from the client's perspective, creating tickets to keep track of progress and diagramming the sequence of the framework we would use. This resulted in coherence between the frontend and backend teams I was in to create production quality code within our [projects](#projects)
* My written communication skills have been furthered in my [blogs](https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh), as well as the README's in my [projects](#projects)

### Natural leader

* As project manager on various group [projects](#projects) at [Makers](#makers-academy-mar-2022-to-jul-2022), I ensured a cohesive and productive working environment. This was achieved by constantly checking in with members and mobbing various blockers to ensure every member understood each piece of code to empower them to work independently. This meant each person worked on a separate task and in turn churned out more features and a more complete app was made as a result
* Leading the way in terms of stand-ups and retros, I made sure every team member was heard and had contributions towards the project. During these times I created a safe place to ask questions and instilled an environment that members could bring up any issues/concerns. This was done by acknowledging every member's strengths and weaknesses at the start of the projects and checking in on their progress. With these constant check ins, a better morale and productivity was felt, making for a happier team that had no unresolved issues, resulting in less conflicts and more production
* In 2011/2012, I captained Aslan FC to their [first ever league title](#hobbies-and-interests), in their first ever year in the competition. With a group of local footballers from ages of 15 - 38, we triumphed and made an unprecedented run to the league title. This reaffirmed my competitive nature and my ability to connect with a wide age group to achieve a common goal

### Thrives under pressure

* By using agile methodologies, specifically extreme programming, I completed my final group [project](#projects) under time constraints and a team member contracting Covid-19. By implementing this work flow, we were able to break the app down into sizable chunks that every member of the group could carry out as a pair or solo, on site or remote. This meant more of the work was achieved in half the time using [Miro](https://miro.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com/en) boards to aide this and keep the progress updated using these tools to know at what stage everyone was at. As a result, we were able to implement an [app](https://github.com/Farzan-I/brains-on-brioche) that received great feedback for its originality and functionality
* While working in [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), deadlines were abrupt. My adaptive nature allowed me to persevere and complete transactions no matter what I faced. These, coupled with my competitive nature, allow me to work effectively when under a time constraint

### Fast learner
* At [Makers](#makers-academy-mar-2022-to-jul-2022), we were encouraged to adopt an active learning approach to the curriculum. This was a way to embrace Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset and adopt an active learning approach to the curriculum. With minimal coaching, I learnt Ruby, JavaScript and React during my time there by adopting various techniques such as [rubber ducking](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/), mastering Google searches and breaking down a problem to bite size chunks using diagramming/mapping to understand the frameworks better. This meant I was able to learn various object orientated languages with ease and push myself to pick up others when needed
* Solely built the website for my previous employer in four days with no prior coding knowledge ([Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020)). Done using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to show me the basics. Looking back, I can vastly improve every aspect of the website comfortably having learnt more skills and tech tools at Makers
* Moving through various customer facing roles, I had to adapt myself to the industry standards within a limited timeframe. This meant learning the cores of the various [businesses](#experience) I was at, deploy their philosophies and meet numerous goals in the process. While at [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), I achieved the highest lettings figures for the company within 6 months. This was due to learning the core aspects of the estate agency industry (mainly how to negotiate better) and applying them in my role

### Exceptional customer service
* Getting noticed in a competitive industry has its benefits. Getting word of mouth referrals represent a stamp of approval from a past client and I received many while at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), [Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020) and [Language Empire](#language-empire-jan-2021-to-dec-2021). This came down to my rapport building with clients by showing empathy and a tailored service to successfully meet every client's needs
* While I was at [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015-management-trainee), I received glowing feedback, three commemorative 'E pins' and over 90% completely satisfied customers for 9 out of the 12 months I was at the specified branch, St John's Wood. This was a massive indication of the commitment I had to providing the best experience possible for a client to ensure they leave on a good note and have us at the forefront of their mind for any future car rental needs
