Detail orientated professional, recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 - July '22). Learnt the fundamentals of the command line, perfecting the use of git alongside completing Ruby, JavaScript (MERN/MEHN) projects using an extensive list of technological tools, while implementing agile methodologies.

As a [marketing executive](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020), I sculpted the [company's website](https://www.culturalsignatures.com) with no prior coding experience. This gave me a great insight and thirst for software engineering. Graduating from [London Metropolitan University](#london-metropolitan-university-sep-2010-to-jul-2014) with a first class degree in Business Management, I spent a year working for [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015-management-trainee) on their graduate scheme. Here, I encountered the IBM software Ralph that started my fascination for software development. I spent 6 months in Dubai working as a [wealth advisor](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016) before I came back to the UK and had cutomer facing roles as a senior lettings negotiator at [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), moving onto a supervisor role in [Pret A Manger](#pret-a-manger-dec-2018-to-aug-2019) before becoming a language translator for [Language Empire](language-empire-jan-2021-to-dec-2021). I have spent the last 18 months learning how to code, 4 of which have been with Makers Academy bootcamp.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

* While at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), I generated client quarterly reports and provided weekly updates on their investments. This put a client's mind at ease, built rapport during uncertain times and in turn created a customer for life
* Providing direction and a clear outline of the task at hand in the various Makers [projects](#projects) I've been in demonstrates my ability to get my point across and translate it into production quality code
* My written communication skills have been furthered in my [blogs](https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh), as well as the README's in my [projects](#projects)

### Natural leader

* As a project manager on various group [tasks](#projects), I ensured a cohesive and productive working environment by making sure every team member was heard and had contributions towards the project. By leading the way in stand-ups and retros, a safe place to learn and bring up any issues was instilled, which meant better morale and above all, no issue left to boil over, resulting in less conflicts and more production
* In 2011/2012, I captained Aslan FC to their [first ever league title](#hobbies-and-interests), in their first ever year in the competition. This reaffirmed my competitive nature as well as my leadership skills

### Thrives under pressure

* By using agile methodologies, specifically extreme programming, I completed my final group [project](#projects) under time constraints. By implementing this work flow, we were able to break the app down into sizable chunks that every member of the group could carry out as a pair or solo. This meant more of the work was achieved in half the time using [Trello](https://trello.com/en) and [Miro](https://miro.com/) boards to aide this. As a result, we were able to implement an [app](https://github.com/Farzan-I/brains-on-brioche) that received great feedback for its originality and functionality
* While working in [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), deadlines were abrupt. My adaptive nature allowed me to persevere and complete transactions no matter what I faced. These, coupled with my competitive nature, allow me to work effectively when under a time constraint

### Fast learner
* By using the [Rubber duck technique](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/), I say a problem out loud to find the root of the issue and break it down. This allows me to feel more confident to tackle the unknown and led me to learning the MERN stack in a week to create the final project of my [Makers course](#projects)
* For our [Acebook project](https://github.com/Farzan-I/acebook), I learnt Node.js, Handlebars and Express independently in a week and used it to build a fully-functioning [Facebook mock website](https://lacebook.herokuapp.com/) 
* I solely built the website for my previous employer in a week ([Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020)) with no prior coding knowledge. This was done through various avenues such as [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to show me the basics. Looking back, I can vastly improve every aspect of the website comfortably having learnt more skills and technological tools at Makers

<!-- ### Shrewd negotiater
In my role at [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), I negotiated deals that had the tenant, landlord and my company's interests at heart. This was done by assessing the situation from all perspectives, judging which needs have to be fulfilled and which could be compromised. 
Achieving the highest lettings figures for the company within 6 months underlined my negotiating skills. At [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015-management-trainee), I finished in the top 25 sales people of South-west England three times in a year. This was achieved by upselling various products such as fully comprehensive insurance on vehicles or upgrading a customer's vehicle class. While at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), I turned cold leads to customers for life by expressing the benefits of a tax free country (United Arab Emirates) and providing products that were tailor made for each client. -->

### Exceptional customer service
* Getting noticed in a competitive industry has its benefits. Getting word of mouth referrals represent a stamp of approval from a past client and I received many while at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), [Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020) and [Language Empire](#language-empire-jan-2021-to-dec-2021) 
* While I was at [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015-management-trainee), I received glowing feedback, three comemorative 'E pins' and over 90% completely satisfied customers for 9 out of the 12 months I was at the specified branch, St John's Wood. This was a massive indication of the commitment I had to providing the best experience possible for a client to ensure they leave on a good note and have us at the forefront of their mind for any future car rental needs
