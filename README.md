Detail orientated 30 year old professional, recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 - July '22). Learnt the fundamentals of the command line, perfecting the use of git alongside completing Ruby, JavaScript (MERN/MEHN) projects using an extensive list of technological tools, while implementing agile methodologies.

Graduating from [London Metropolitan University](#london-metropolitan-university-sep-2010-to-jul-2014) with a first class degree in Business Management, I spent a year working for [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015) on their graduate scheme. Here, I encountered the IBM software Ralph that started my fascination for software development. I spent 6 months in Dubai working as a [wealth advisor](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016) before I came back to the UK and had roles as a senior lettings negotiator at [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), moving onto a supervisor role in [Pret A Manger](#pret-a-manger-dec-2018-to-aug-2019). I was also a [marketing executive](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020) for a period where I sculpted the [company's website](https://www.culturalsignatures.com) with no prior coding experience. I have spent the last 8 months learning how to code and 4 of which have been with Makers Academy bootcamp.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

During my time at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), I wrote and distributed client quarterly reports, while providing regular weekly updates on their investments. This constant update put a client's mind at ease, building trust and rapport, creating a customer for life. While at [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015), providing clarity on many issues clients faced was my fortay. Achieved this by providing a clear breakdown of costs to eleviate any concerns they may have. Providing cohesion and direction in the various Makers projects I have been in highlights my communication skills. My written communication skills have been rehearsed in my [blogs](https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh), as well as the README's in various [projects](#projects).

### Natural leader

Studying towards a First Class degree in [Business Management](#london-metropolitan-university-sep-2010-to-jul-2014), I applied my learnings while working at [Pizza Express](#pizza-express-dec-2010-to-oct-2014) as a manager. This allowed me to demonstrate my understandings and see the benefits of being a leader as opposed to a boss. As a project manager on various group works, I ensured a cohesive and productive working environment by making sure every team member was heard and made contributions towards the project. This meant better morale, a safe place to learn and above all, everyone believing they are a better software developer than they were yesterday. In 2011/2012, I captained Aslan FC to their [first ever league title](#hobbies-and-interests), in their first ever year in the competition. This reaffirmed my competitive nature as well as my leadership skills.

### Thrives under pressure
From having to organise an end-of-year prom during my final year of [secondary school](#st-georges-roman-catholic-school-feb-2003-to-jul-2008), where all of the planning coincided with completing GCSE exams, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this. While working in [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), deadlines were abrupt. My adaptive nature allowed me to persevere and complete transactions no matter what I faced. These, coupled with my competitive nature, allow me to work effectively when under a time constraint.

### Fast learner
Learnt the MERN stack in a week to create the final project of my [Makers course](#projects). I earned a full-time offer from [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016) by impressing the regional manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of the various financial products that the team used and sold to clients. I was told only 1 out of 200 candidates would pass the rigorous job screening. For our [Acebook project](https://github.com/Farzan-I/acebook), I learnt Node.js and Express independently in a week and used it to build a fully-functioning [Facebook style website](https://lacebook.herokuapp.com/). I solely built the website for my previous employer in a week ([Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020)) with no prior coding knowledge. Looking back, I can vastly improve every aspect of the website comfortably having learnt more skills at Makers.

### Shrewd negotiater
In my role at [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018), I negotiated deals that had the tenant, landlord and my company's interests at heart. This was done by assessing the situation from all perspectives, judging which needs have to be fulfilled and which could be compromised. Achieving the highest lettings figures for the company within 6 months underlined my negotiating skills. At [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015), I finished in the top 25 sales people of South-west England three times in a year. This was achieved by upselling various products such as fully comprehensive insurance on vehicles or upgrading a customer's vehicle class. While at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), I turned cold leads to customers for life by expressing the benefits of a tax free country (United Arab Emirates) and providing products that were tailor made for each client.

### Exceptional customer service
In a competitive industry, it helps to get noticed. One way to do so is treat every client as if it is your first and last. Doing this meant word of mouth referrals from clients while at [deVere Group](#devere-acuma-devere-group-may-2016-to-nov-2016), [AXM London](#axm-london-property-services-dec-2017-to-nov-2018) and [Cultural Signatures](#cultural-signatures-mar-2020-to-nov-2020) and [Language Empire](#language-empire-jan-2021-to-dec-2021). While I was at [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](#enterprise-rent-a-car-nov-2014-to-dec-2015), I received glowing feedback, three comemorative 'E pins' and over 90% completely satisfied customers for 9 out of the 12 months I was at the specified branch, St John's Wood.n
