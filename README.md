Detail orientated 30 year old professional, current Makers Academy student (April '22 intake) about to complete the full time coding bootcamp. Learnt the fundamentals of the computers command line, extensive hours trying to perfect the use of git commands and branching/merging while completing Ruby and JavaScript projects using an extensive list of technological tools, as well as working methodologies.

After graduating from London Metropolitan University with a first class degree in Business Management, I spent a year working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car through their graduate scheme. Here I came to terms with the IBM software Ralph that started my fascination for software development. I also spent 6 months in Dubai working as a wealth advisor before I came back to the UK and had roles as a senior lettings negotiator at AXM London, moving onto a supervisor role in Pret A Manger. I have spent the last 8 months learning how to code and 4 of which have been with Makers Academy bootcamp.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

During my time at deVere Group, I wrote and distributed client quarterly reports as well as providing them with regular weekly updates on their investments. This constant communication put a client's mind at ease, which built trust and better rapport, turning a client to a customer for life. While at Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I was pinpointed for providing clarity on many issues customers faced (corporate and public). This was achieved by providing a clear breakdown of the invoice even before a customer drove away. This skill has been put into practice during my time at Makers and perfected as I have provided cohesion and direction on the various teams I was in. My written communication skills have been rehearsed in my [blogs](https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh), as well as the README's for my [projects](#projects).

### Natural leader

By achieving a First Class degree in [Business Management](#london-metropolitan-university-sep-2010-to-jul-2014), I applied my understanding of being a better leader while working at Pizza Express as a manager. This allowed me to demonstrate my learnings instantly and see the benefits of being a leader as opposed to a boss. Organically being put forward for project manager on various group works, I ensured a cohesive and productive working environment by making sure every team member was heard and have made contributions towards the project. This meant better morale, a safe place to learn and above all, everyone believing they are a better software developer than they were yesterday. In 2011/2012, I captained Aslan FC to their [first ever league title](#hobbies-and-interests), in their first ever year in the competition. This reaffirmed my competitive nature as well as my leadership skills.

### Thrives under pressure
From having to organise an end-of-year prom during my final year of secondary school, where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing GCSE exams, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this. These, coupled with my competitive nature, allow me to work effectively when also under a time constraint.

### Fast learner
I earned a full-time offer from deVere Group by impressing my line and regional manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of the various financial products that the team used and sold to clients. Despite having a business management background, I was told only 1 out of 200 candidates would pass the rigorous job screening. For our [Acebook project](https://github.com/Farzan-I/acebook), I learnt Node.js and Express independently in a week and used it to build a fully-functioning Facebook style website. I solely built the website for my previous employer, [Cultural Signatures](https://www.culturalsignatures.com/) with no prior coding knowledge. Looking back on it, I can vastly improve every aspect of the website comfortably and showcases what I can achieve within a week.

### Shrewd negotiater
In my role at AXM London, I negotiated deals that had the tenant, landlord as well as my company's best interests at heart. This was done by assessing the situation from all perspectives, seeing what needs have to be fulfilled and what can be compromised. Achieving the highest lettings figures for the company within 6 months underlined my effective negotiating skills. Amongst large competitors such as Knight Frank and Savills, I was highly recognised for taking their properties off the market and doing 'split deals' with them. This led to being offered roles in these companies as well as other estate agencies. Within Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I finished in the top 25 sales people of South-west England three times in a year. This was achieved by upselling various products such as fully comprehensive insurance on vehicles and/or upgrading a customer to another vehicle class. While at deVere Group, I turned cold leads to clients for life by communicating the added value of being in a tax free country (United Arab Emirates) and providing products that were tailor made for every client. This meant I had an active pipeline of deals flowing and in turn generated more revenue.

### Exceptional customer service
In a competitive industry, it helps to get noticed. One way to do so is treat every client as if it is your first and last. This meant word of mouth referrals from clients while I was at deVere Group and AXM London

This was then underlined by the glowing feedback I received and over 90% completely satisfied customers we had for 9 out of the 12 months I was at the specified branch, St John's Wood, reiterating my communication and [customer service](#exceptional-customer-service) skills.
